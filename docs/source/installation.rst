Installation
============

Python Version
--------------

We recommend using the latest version of Python 3. Snips NLU supports Python
3.4 and newer as well as Python 2.7.


Install Snips NLU
-----------------

It is recommended to use a `virtual environment`_ and activate it before
installing Snips NLU in order to manage your project dependencies properly.

Snips NLU can be installed via pip with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install snips-nlu


We currently have pre-built binaries (wheels) for ``snips-nlu`` and its
dependencies for MacOS and Linux x86_64. If you use a different
architecture/os you will need to build these dependencies from sources
which means you will need to install
`setuptools_rust <https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust>`_ and
`Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html>`_ before running the
``pip install snips-nlu`` command.

Extra dependencies

If at some point you want to compute metrics, you will need some extra
dependencies that can be installed via:

    pip install 'snips-nlu[metrics]'
